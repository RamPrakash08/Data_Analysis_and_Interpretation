Abstract:
The phenomena of high energy collisions are studied using particle accelerators such as the Large Hadron Collider. This helps us to ascertain the characteristics of events like proton-proton collisions and infer scientific conclusions. These experiments serve to test the principles of the Standard Model of Particle Physics. In this report, we present the analysis of the charge asymmetry distribution in proton-proton collisions in different multiplicity
classes, the multiplicity distribution in charge and asymmetry regions and the pT , η, φ distribution in charge symmetric and asymmetric regions. The data provided is generated using Pythia 8 Monte Carlo event generator replicating the collision events.
